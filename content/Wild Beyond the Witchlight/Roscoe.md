# Backstory
Roscoe was something of rascal as child. While his brother Fosco was much more serious and older than Roscoe. When their parents Drogo and Primula passed a way in a boating accident, Fosco was the one to take over the family business. Roscoe was still a teenager at the time, so their uncle (technically second cousin of their father) Bungo moved in to take care of them.

Bungo was rather eccentric and used to be an adventurer in his youth. Roscoe had always been curious of the wider world outside of their halfling community and spent much of his time listening to Bungo's stories.

Eventually he got to meet one of Bungo's old adventuring companions. A powerful wizard by the name of Incanus. He even learned a few simple spells from him! After pestering them enough about wanting be an adventurer himself, Incanus agreed to take him to study ancient dungeons in a school of archaeology. 

Roscoe didn't spend too long at the school before he found someone that sold him a treasure map to an ancient ruin that was in a newly discovered continent. Roscoe didn't think twice if this was true or not, but got the map and found himself on a ship sailing to an unknown continent, far away from his comfortable and safe halfling home.
