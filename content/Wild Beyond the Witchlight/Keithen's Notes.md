3 regions: hither (Bavlorna), thither (skabatha), yonder (Endelyn). ruled by hags.

Big palace in center: Palace of Hearts Desire - Zybilnas place. Frozen in time. Keys to her castle: silver/gold crown, to be placed on the correct guardian.
*Golden Stag named [[Wrath]]. Silver Stag or something else named [[Envy]]. These are the Guardians. Silver needles or Golden Roses. Only one chance to unlock the Palace, after that the crown is gone.*

We need a ==unicorns horn (alichorn)== for something regarding [[zybilna]]

[[Hourglass coven]] betraed [[zybilna]] (with help of mercs) and timefroze her.
*Used to be advisors to Zyblina. Some cauldron in the Palace is key to the freezing effect. Protected by [[Jabberwock]] that can be slain by [[Vorpal Sword]] that is behind a password protected door. Some frog person named [[Iggrik]] on top of a bean on top of the Palace. Could try to unfreeze Zybilnas owl named [[Bloodbeak]] that could slay the [[Jabberwock]].*

There's some cauldron in the keep that might keeps her sealed or smth.

Meet antler serpent: [[Curie]]. near palace, at lake *in a cave*. She will give us the crown once we have dealt with one of the [[hourglass coven]] hags, and figured out how to re-solve the timefreeze. She'll have a quest for us when we grow stronger.
*Will also have a quest when we are stronger.*

There was some attack. To cover the retreat of [[Sir Talavar|Talavar]] (fairy dragon lord, emissary of [[summer court]]). *Happened before Party arrived. [[Sir Talavar|Talavar]] escaped from Bavlorna. One of the underlings was caught and the party talked to him.*

There was some balloon travelling merchant. Owned by [[Charm]] (has no shadow).

Current king sends us to Bavlorna as emissaries, returning "Bavlorna's Big Book of Bad Blood"

She tells us about her sister, Skabatha: 
- lives in giant hollowed out tree in loomlurch/hither
- possible ally for us: [[will of the feywild]]
- Skabatha has tricksy memory. every morning, the first person she sees, she forgets. and the person is invisible for her that day. once she sleeps, she remembers that person again.

if we want to do Bavlorna a favour:
- retrieve Skabatha's portrait from her lair

Meet with [[Agdorn Longscarf]]. He wants Bavlorna's place. Tells us Skapbathas minions are decent fighters. [[Gleam]]/[[Glister]] was on her way to Yorn *(Yonder)*.
*[[Gleam]] and [[Glister]] are twins. Sun and moon of the circus.*
