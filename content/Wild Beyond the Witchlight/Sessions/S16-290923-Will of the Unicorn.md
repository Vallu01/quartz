## Recap of Last Session
![[S15-220923-Juniper & Jabber#Session Summary|no-h]]
## Session Summary
The Party made their way north through Thither following directions from Roscoe's ring. Along the way they found more wanted posters of [[Will of the Feywild]], which we later found out were put up by Skabatha's "tin men". 
The Party also came across a stream that very big gold fishes floating above it, following the stream. Their scales were made of gold coins that turned out to be wooden after removed.
Last curiosity on the road was a small book collection inside a tree that hand a little windowed door with a sign "Leave a book, take a book."

The Party finally met a [[Will of the Feywild]] and his Getaway Gang. They ended up planning on how to free rest children from Skabatha's workshop. The plan is for the Party to enter the Goblin Market and pose as merchants wanting to buy sweets. Using this an in to get a meeting with Skabatha and get inside the workshop. The Getaway gang would set of some scarecrows to draw the tin soldiers out. Then both parties would convene and free the children from the workshop.

The Party decided to go with an unicorn by the lake that the Getaway Gang mentioned. There is a forcefield around the lake that you could pass through as long as you pretended to be an unicorn. After lighting coals inside an iron bull an unicorn was summoned.
