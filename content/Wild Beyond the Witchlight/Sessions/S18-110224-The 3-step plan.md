## Recap of Last Session
![[S17-031123-Unicorn Talkshow#Session Summary|no-h]]
## Session Summary
After a long re-planning session that was totally useful the party headed to Loomlurch to enact the 3-step plan.

First the party talked to Chucklehead, a toffee apple headed goblin, who apparently has a maggot inside his head that he talks to. After sampling some candies that made Whoodini's head swell twice it's size, Chucklehead lead the party to the audience chamber to meet Skabatha.

During the meeting Skabatha offered the party a supply of candy in exchange for sabotaging her sister Enderlyn's theatrical premiere at Motherhorn castle.

Skabatha also let it slip that the hags have trouble moving in and out of Prismeer. And that they have a fourth sister named [[Natasha]], who she called "Mama's favourite".

Skabatha was then distracted by the Getaway Gang, leaving the party alone, but restrained by the mimic chairs. The party then flawlessly followed the plan to save the children, without deviating or getting distracted.

During the some extra hag distraction Roscoe found out that gardens are fertilised by skeletons. While pursued by said skeletons he managed to yoink the [[Oink]] and flee to safety.

Meanwhile rest of the party made their way to the kitchen where the met up with Will and managed to save [[Sir Talavar]] and a dwarf named [[Elkhorn]].
