## Recap of Last Session
![[S14-080923-Meet the Party#Session Summary|no-h]]
## Session Summary
The Party found an owlbear named [[Juniper]]. Hey Listen knew it from beforehand and Nolan has some sort of connection as well. The owner, [[Lunelis Wildfill]] was found unconscious. We found out that he was part of the [[Summer Court]] and was sent by [[Titania]] to find [[Sir Talavar]] and to find weaknesses in Prismeer's and the Palace's defences. And how to get in and out of Prismeer with [[Zybilna]]'s approval or knowledge.

The [[Jabberwock]] was hunting Lunelis and attacked the party. It managed to kill Lunelis before escaping. Almost killing Roscoe in the process. On Lunelis' body we found a locket with a picture of [[Juniper]] as a cub, orders from [[Titania]] and braces. Both with the insignia of [[Titania]]. Red Rose on Field of Green.
