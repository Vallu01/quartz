## Recap of Last Session
![[S20-150324-Hag Evicted#Session Summary|no-h]]
## Session Summary
In 8 days [[Titania]] of the [[Summer Court]] will invade Prismeer. The [[Hourglass Coven]] proposed a meeting in 5 days at Downfall to discuss an alliance against the [[Summer Court]] to save Prismeer from destruction. If the party does not agree, Skabatha threatened to hurt the children she still has.

Upon consulting [[Lamorna]], the party decided the hags cannot be trusted. So the best course of action to save Prismeer and the children is to free [[Zybilna]]. [[Sir Talavar]] was originally trying to negotiate an alliance with [[Zybilna]] before being capture first by [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] and then [[Skabatha Nightshade]]. So there may yet be peace between them. Or if not, then [[Zybilna]] should be powerful enough to stand against [[Titania]].

The party also learned that [[Titania]] was envious of [[Zybilna]]. As [[Titania]] didn't like the fact that someone who wasn't born Fey was ruling a Fey realm. According to [[Lamorna]] [[Zybilna]] was a human before being adopted by [[Baba Yaga]].

The party then made a plan to get the [[Alichorn]] from Enderlyn, return to [[Curie]] to make a plan on how to unfreeze time at the [[Palace of Heart's Desire]] and free [[Zybilna]]. And before or after that go save the children from [[Skabatha Nightshade]]

With help from [[Sowpig]] the party ventured to [[Yon]], being attacked by [[darklings]] and [[Shadow|shadows]] in between [[Yon]] and Thither.  Upon arrival the party came upon an elven figure, a humanoid dandelion and a honeybee the size of an orange.
