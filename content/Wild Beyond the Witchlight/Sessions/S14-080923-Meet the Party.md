## Recap of Last Session

## Session Summary
Roscoe was looking for a Ring of Heart's Desire. [[Meadowleaf]] told him about a secret entrance to [[Nib's Cave]] . After plummeting down a chute, he got trapped in a chest. Hey Listen saved him from the chest. The door to the cavern closed and a puzzle with levers needed to be solved to escape. The Party fought mimics on the way out.  JRP picked up the [[Mimic]] that used to a book titled "How to spot a [[Mimic]]".

The Party was sent in by [[Nib]] to investigate a knocking sound that turned out to be Roscoe trapped in the chest. As a thank you [[Nib]] made uncommon magic items for the party. Roscoe then said that he owes them a favour. Roscoe and Hey Listen made a deal where Roscoe helps them to find their friend. It was made a official by a Feywild scroll.

The Party then headed north and encountered a sleeping Owlbear with a yoke and chariot. The yoke had the name "[[Juniper]]" on it.
