## Recap of Last Session
![[S21-220924-Over Yonder#Session Summary|no-h]]

## Session Summary
The party met Amidor of House Taraxa, Queen Bee Polynella of Hither and [[Gleam]]. Amidor and Polynella were trying to flee Prismeer due to having run afoul of cyclops named Mudlop in Hither. Amidor had made a deal with Bavlorna where they bargained away their ability to bloom.

[[Gleam]] had been wandering around [[Yon]] after [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]] snipped away her [[shadow]] and imprisoned her sister [[Gleam]] in the dungeons below [[Motherhorn Castle]]. [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]] is very paranoid and thinks she can only die during an eclipse and saw the [[Gleam]] and [[Glister]], who are known as a "Sun and the Moon of the carnival" as threat to her wellbeing. [[Gleam]] had been keeping tabs on [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]] by paying of the goblin stagehands [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]] employs.

The two groups that could help against [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]] are the Korreds and Brigganocks, both native to [[Yon]]. The party first ventured to meet with Korreds at [[Lockbury Henge]]. Upon arriving they only saw 8 standing stones that were warm to the touch and unfinished game of chess. Finishing the game prompted the Korreds to reveal themselves from hiding inside the stones.

Two clan bosses, Agantle of Marble and Jadu of Obsidian addressed the party. They called [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]] the "[[Enderlyn Moongrave|Bitter End]]" and offered to help the party in their efforts against her. More specifically they offered to teach a dance that would weaken the stone underneath the [[Motherhorn Castle]] and potentially bring it down. In return they wanted the party to stop the noise the [[Brigganock]]s were making and stop them from manufacturing contraptions for [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]]. 

The party set off towards the [[Brigganock]] Mine and as per instructions went around the lake in southern [[Yon]] counter clockwise three times and were promptly teleported just outside of the their destination. 

Upon entering the mine the clanking and hammering previously heard from the mine immediately stopped. The narrow pathways of the mine looped back to the entrance through conjuration magic. On the second go around there was also abjuration magic in the air paired with rhythmic and hypnotic hammering. This magic soon started to put the party to asleep.

[[Roscoe]], managing to stay awake, but pretending to sleep, saw Brigganocks come out with wheelbarrows and rope and start tying up the party. Once they were done a human clad in leather armour and a friendly expression came out to watch over the party.
