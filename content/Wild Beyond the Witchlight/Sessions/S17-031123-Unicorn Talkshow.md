## Recap of Last Session
![[S16-290923-Will of the Unicorn#Session Summary|no-h]]
## Session Summary
The Party had a long conversation with the Unicorn named [[Lamorna]], learning a lot of useful information.

Lamorna had a mate called Ellidon, who was taken by the hags. The hags took away Ellidon's horn and used it to imprison [[Zybilna]]. It's still intact and it's needed to free [[Zybilna]].
Ellidon was last seen at mushroom circle in Eastern Thither dancing with the mushroom people. The hags attacked with their minions, Skabatha's tin men, Bavlorna's frog people and [[Enderlyn Moongrave|Enderlyn]]'s shadow people.

Lamorna also told that some of the party have curses on them.
Hey listen is allergic to squirrels, is missing a letter in his name and one unknown life altering curse.
Nolan can get burned by moonlight, no sense of smell or taste and one unknown life altering curse.
Hey listen's curse was lifted and he could remember his real name. Heilysen Navi.

The Party also got some intel on [[Loomlurch]]. The Tin Men carry shortswords and shields, they are small and loud and mechanical constructs.
There are boggles, small oily fey that can be either sticky or slippery and can teleport 30ft.
Skabatha is usually in the meeting room
Every time Skabatha's key stops turning, Redcaps come out of the ground.

Satisfied the Party left to meet back with Will and the Runaway Gang.
