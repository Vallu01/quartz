## Recap of Last Session
![[S18-110224-The 3-step plan#Session Summary|no-h]]
## Session Summary
The party returned to [[Little Oak]] to chat with the people rescued from [[Loomlurch]].

[[Sir Talavar]] confirmed that [[Zybilna]] is the sister of the 3 hags. He also knew the Iggy and their full name Iggwilv. Who was adopted by [[Baba Yaga]], the mother of hags.
The big tree and the big bridge both used to be intact back when [[Zybilna]] ruled. And the 3 domains were not separated by mist back then.

Pilot Wigglewog and Bullywug knight Morgort helped [[Sir Talavar]] escape the bullywugs in Downfall using a gas balloon. They crashed atop the Slanted Tower in Hither, where they were attacked by 3 giant snakes, Skabatha's pets. The pilot perished while Morgort stayed back in Downfall and [[Sir Talavar]] was captured.

The Party met a member of the Valor's Call. A dwarf named [[Elkhorn]]. They fought the League of Malevolence in the Palace of the Heart's Desire, where [[Elkhorn]] was captured.
Valor's call include:
- Ringlerun, Human Wizard
	- Has a Staff of Power from a Merit
- Molliver, Human Rogue, impatient
- Strongheart, Human Paladin, Leader, sword named Steel 
League of Malevolence include:
- Leader: Kelek: Human wizard, wants Staff of Power from Ringlerun
- Warduke, Human, no mercy, flametongue
- Zarak, Orcish Assassin, Orcus worshipper
- Zargash, Human priest of Orcus, true fanatic
- Skylla, human warlock, untrustworthy

The portrait found in Loomlurch shows whoever "donated" blood and their 3 closes relatives.
