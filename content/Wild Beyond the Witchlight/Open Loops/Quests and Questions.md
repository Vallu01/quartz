## Dryads
- [ ] As part of the Favour for Dryads of Nova's Thornleaf Forest. [[Roscoe]] needs to get a unicorn horn (without the unicorn attached).
	- Their sister [[Meadowleaf]] was waiting on the other side in a mushroom circle.
	- She is bitter and angry. Her tree has been badly damaged by [[Skabatha Nightshade]]. Skabatha is a hag.
	- [[Meadowleaf]] told about a ring that can help locate the horn. It's in a cave westward where an old man called [[Nib]] resides. But she told not to care about him and use a secret entrance to the treasure room.
		- Roscoe used the secret entrance and plummeted down a chute to an open treasure chest, which then closed and trapped Roscoe inside.
	- The ring when worn and attuned leads you towards your hearts greatest desire. Twice a day you can use it to get a little nudge in the direction of your hearts greatest desire. There is a catch though. While attuned to it you can no longer form new bird-related memories
	- The rest of the party needs a unicorn horn ([[alichorn]]) for something as well
