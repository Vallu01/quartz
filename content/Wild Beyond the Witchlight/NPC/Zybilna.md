- Archfey
- Currently frozen in time in her Palace of Hearts Desire
- Asked Mercion of Valor's Call in Waterdeep to smite evil
- [[Hourglass Coven]], [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] [[Enderlyn Moongrave]] and [[Skabatha Nightshade]] served her in the past.
	- They betrayed her and caused her to be frozen in time
	- There is some cauldron in her palace that keeps her frozen in time
		- It's protected by a [[Jabberwock]]
		- We need a [[Vorpal sword]] to slay the [[Jabberwock]]
			- The Sword is behind a password protected door
			- Some frog person named [[Iggrik]] on top of the palace knows the password
		- We could try to unfreeze Zybilna's owl named [[Bloodbeak]]. It can slay the [[Jabberwock]]
- In the past she nailed [[Agdorn Longscarf]] to a tree as a punishment
	- Because she wanted his scarf?
