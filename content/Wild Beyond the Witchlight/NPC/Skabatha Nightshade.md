> [!Quote] Bavlorna's Big Book of Bad Blood
Skatty is too cruel... I see what those who deal with her come to... How devious to deceive and assume false forms. I have no patience for such trickery, and I despise her for it. I long for the day Lynni and I cause her utter collapse and tear her share of Prismeer apart. I should get the lion's share, of course...
